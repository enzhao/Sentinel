# Welcome to the Sentinel User Manual 

Welcome! This guide will help you get the most out of Sentinel, your personal investment strategy assistant.

## Automate Your Investment Strategy 🚀

Sentinel is a tool designed for busy, hands-on investors who want to apply a disciplined, rule-based strategy without having to watch the market 24/7. You define your strategy, and Sentinel monitors the market for you, sending you timely alerts when your conditions are met, without actively executing any trades, leaving you as the ultimate decision-maker.

Sentinel puts you in full control by combining automated, rule-based alerts with a powerful performance dashboard. You can track your returns with interactive charts, overlay key technical indicators to understand market trends, and see your potential gains with tax information taken into account.

## Is Sentinel Right For You?

Sentinel is designed for a specific type of investor. You'll feel right at home if you are a:

* ✅ **Swing or Positional Trader** who uses daily charts.
* ✅ **Disciplined, rule-based investor** looking to remove emotion from your decisions.
* ✅ **Busy professional** who doesn't have time to watch the market all day.
* ✅ **Investor who'd rather save on management fees to maximize market gains.**

However, Sentinel is likely **not** the right tool if you are a day trader who needs real-time, intraday data. Our monitoring runs on daily closing prices.
